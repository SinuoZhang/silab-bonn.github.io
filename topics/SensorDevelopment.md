# Sensor Development
From the daily using digital camera, medical X-ray imaging device to the particle tracker of the high energy physics experiments, silicon pixel sensors efficiently convert photons and charged particles to electric signal. Like all semiconductor devices, the development of pixel sensors follows the cyclic procedure of: design &rarr; produce &rarr; test &rarr; optimization, aiming to optimum perfomances such as higher spatial resolution, lower leakage, higher efficiency. Especially in the high energy physics, radiation tolerant sensors need to be developed to sustain severe radiation damage.

## Device Simulation and Optimization
Numerical simulation offers an efficiency way for testing and optimzing pixel sensors. TCAD ( **T**echnology **C**omputer **A**ided **D**esign) is a powerful software for such purposes and widely used in the semiconductor industry. You will first need an insight on the general semiconductor device manufacturing processes and construct the sensor with the software. The device simulation offers you a chance to proceed experiments, while exploring enormous amount of physical models and discovering the physics behind the data. 

### Topic: Guard Rings
- Type: Master
- Location: SiLab
- Contact: [Sinuo Zhang] (mailto: s.zhang@physik.uni-bonn.de)
- Description: Guard rings locate outside of the sensitive area of the pixel detector, surround the pixel matrix to supply the voltage and form the electric field on the sensor's edge. Nevertheless, the situation there is more complex and the design of guard rings is crucial for suppressing the leakage current and pushing up the limit of breakdown voltage.
- Tool: TCAD
- Tasks: Simulate the guard rings of test structures, find out and discuss the impacts of the design and the operation conditions on related sensor performances.  Find out or design an optimum guard ring geometry.
- Possible extension: include the radiation damage and discuss the impacts.
